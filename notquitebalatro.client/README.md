# Not Quite Balatro

A tool for drawing cards via a web API, evaluating winners and losers, and demonstrating coding acumen.

# Setup:
This project was built with Visual Studio 2022, and opening the .sln file should allow for the project to run with minimal effort.

If not using Visual Studio 2022, the project has two subdivisions, the server and the client, which will need to be run separately.

## Server Setup
